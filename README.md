# Valheim Player Manager
This project was built as an extension of a Valheim game server. 
This application utilizes web endpoints to recieve player join and disconnect information and decode it through the steam API to relay the retrieved player username to a designated discord channel webhook. 

All keys and configuation is stored in the Linux enviornment variables when deploying via docker.
